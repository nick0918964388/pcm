# Feature Specification: ÁÖßÁâáÁÆ°ÁêÜÁ≥ªÁµ± (Photo Management System)

**Feature Branch**: `001-photo-management`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ÁÖßÁâáÁÆ°ÁêÜ ÂèØ‰ª•È†êË¶ΩÁÖßÁâá ‰∏äÂÇ≥ÁÖßÁâá ÂèØ‰ª•ËàáÂ∞àÊ°àÈÄ£Áµê ‰∏¶‰∏îÊîØÊè¥Áõ∏Á∞øÂäüËÉΩ Áõ∏Áâá‰∏äÂèØ‰ª•Ê®ôË®ªË≥áË®äËàáÊó•Êúü"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Photo management with preview, upload, project linking, albums, annotations
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: users, projects
   ‚Üí Actions: preview, upload, link, annotate, organize
   ‚Üí Data: photos, albums, annotations, dates, projects
   ‚Üí Constraints: system design consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary user flows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (photos, albums, annotations)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project manager or team member, I want to manage and organize photos related to my projects so that I can visually document project progress, share visual information with stakeholders, and maintain a historical record of project activities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has access to a project, **When** they navigate to the photo management section, **Then** they can view all photos associated with that project in a grid layout with thumbnails
2. **Given** a user is viewing the photo gallery, **When** they click on a photo thumbnail, **Then** the photo opens in a preview mode showing full resolution with annotations and date information
3. **Given** a user has appropriate permissions, **When** they select upload, **Then** they can upload one or more photos and associate them with the current project
4. **Given** a photo is uploaded, **When** the user adds annotations, **Then** the text and date information is saved and displayed on the photo
5. **Given** multiple photos exist, **When** a user creates an album, **Then** they can organize related photos into that album for better categorization
6. **Given** a photo exists in the system, **When** viewing project details, **Then** linked photos are accessible and viewable from the project context
7. **Given** a user is viewing the photo gallery, **When** they select a quick date filter (e.g., "last week"), **Then** only photos uploaded within that time period are displayed
8. **Given** a user needs specific date range filtering, **When** they select custom date range and specify start/end dates, **Then** only photos uploaded within that custom period are displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum file size for uploads not specified]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: duplicate photo uploads - prevent or allow]?
- What happens when a project is deleted [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: are associated photos deleted or orphaned]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: unsupported image formats]?
- What occurs when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: storage quota is exceeded]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to preview photos in both thumbnail grid view and full-size view
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable users to upload photos with support for common image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to link photos to specific projects
- **FR-004**: System MUST support creating and managing photo albums for organizing related photos
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to add text annotations to photos
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to add or modify date information for each photo
- **FR-007**: Photo layout MUST maintain visual consistency with the existing system design
- **FR-008**: System MUST display photo metadata including annotation text , upload date time , name , location ,uploader
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to navigate between photos within an album or project collection
- **FR-010**: System MUST support bulk operations - select multiple photos for delete/move/download
- **FR-011**: System MUST enforce login user can view/upload/edit/delete photos
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle photo deletion with permanent deletion
- **FR-013**: System MUST support searching/filtering photos by annotation text , upload date time , name , location ,uploader
- **FR-014**: System MUST paginate photo galleries when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pagination threshold - number of photos per page?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Photo**: Represents an uploaded image with associated metadata (upload date, file size, dimensions), annotations, custom date, and project linkage
- **Album**: A collection of related photos that can span across projects or be project-specific
- **Annotation**: Text-based information attached to a specific photo including descriptive text and date information
- **Project-Photo Link**: Relationship between photos and projects, allowing photos to be associated with one or more projects

5. **Storage Quota**: Per-user or per-project storage limits?
6. **Photo Metadata**: Which metadata fields to display?
7. **Bulk Operations**: Support for multi-select operations?
8. **Access Permissions**: Who can view/upload/edit/delete photos?
9. **Deletion Type**: Soft delete with recovery or permanent deletion?
10. **Search Capabilities**: Which fields should be searchable?
12. **Album Scope**: Can albums span projects or are they project-specific?
13. **Photo Sharing**: Can photos be shared externally or only within system?
14. **Version Control**: Track photo edit history or just current version?
